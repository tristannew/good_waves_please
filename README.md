# Good Waves Please

### What is it?
A simple streamlit app in development. Currently, the app provides a conveninent way for a surfer to say how much they enjoyed a surf, where and when it was, and then uses the wonderful `pysurfline` api to collect data on the conditions of that surf. It only works for UK based spots at the moment (though this can be easily expanded, as needed). This surf session data is then stored in a database (locally, but I am setting up a cloud based solution). My hope is that eventually, there will be enough data here to get some meaningful insight into which spots are the most fun, depending on the conditions. Maybe even allowing for some fun machine learning! 

### Why does it exist?
The motivation for this project was when I turned up to one of my favourite spots at what I thought was my favourite tide to surf it. Unfortunately, I forgot how big of a difference there is between neap and spring high tides. Since waves of a certain size need a specific depth of water to break, this difference in tides (i.e. a 5m high tide vs a 7m high tide) can truly be the difference between an amazing session, or turning up to flatwater. Maybe I am just bad at reading forecasts. Maybe this will help. Maybe it won't. At the very least, it'll be fun.
